<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

This project is a simple e-commerce system. It consists of a total of four main backend services (Authentication, Order, Payment, Product), along with one MySQL database, one Redis cache, one Gateway, and a service management and orchestration center. Additionally, a meticulously implemented front-end based on Angular is set up with Nginx, which serves as a reverse proxy to address CORS issues.

First, the **user interface** sends the client's requests to the server side.

Next, the **gateway** acts as a single facade that redirects user requests to the various internal services. It routes requests based on the path or type of service requested, facilitating traffic management to the appropriate services without the client needing to know the underlying architecture.

The **authentication service** is used to generate a token that allows users to automatically authenticate with other services.

The **Order service** manages everything related to orders, such as creation, updating, and deletion. It is connected to two types of databases: **MySQL and Redis**. For reading data, it first queries the cache (Redis). If the data is not found in Redis, it then consults MySQL. After reading, the data is inserted into the cache to facilitate future reads.

Once the Order service receives a payment request, it communicates with the **Payment service** to process the payment via **Grpc**, and then stores the information in the database.

The Order service then sends a request to the **Product service**, also via Grpc, to update the stock in the database.

In case of failure during data registration, the **SAGA model** is used to compensate for operations and ensure data consistency.

Note: All services are registered in a **service management and orchestration center**, which I am using **Consul**.

### Initiation of Database and it's tables

In this project, we use JPA to initialize the database and automatically create the relevant tables through annotations. It is also used for the mapping layer to ensure smooth communication between the server side and the database.

**Client side**

```yaml
services:  
  frontend: 
    build: # Build the image by Dockerfile
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports: # Port mapping to 80
      - "80:80"
    volumes:  # Volume binding for main html page and nginx configuration file 
      - ./dist/frontend:/usr/share/nginx/html
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```


## Dockerfiles

We use 6 separate Dockerfiles to build the different services (Order, Payment, Product, Authentication, Gateway, Frontend), here we list 2 different examples because of the similarity of each file.

**Server side**
```Dockerfile
# Use of basical image jdk
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
# Environment variables
ENV author=LIU

# Root path in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Jar file from host machine into container
COPY auth/Authentication-8083-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Entry point, when container starts, this command will definitively executed to start the java program
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]  
```


**Client side**
```Dockerfile

# Use of basical image Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine  

# Copy the Angular built package from host machine into container
COPY dist/frontend/browser /usr/share/nginx/html  

# Copy Nginx configuration file into container
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
# Expose port 80 to the host machine
EXPOSE 80  

```


## **Starting with Docker**

1. Preparation Phase
   
   **Server side**
   - Pull the necessary images from Docker Hub: mysql:8.0, consul:1.15.4, redis:7.4
   - Organize the JAR files, Dockerfiles, and docker-compose.yml according to the structure below:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1950bff-5ba4-4428-9051-220f6f46cc11)

   **Client side**
   - Build the project by using ng build --configuration production, which will generate an essential folder named dist.
   - Place the dist folder, docker-compose.yml, and nginx.conf together in the same root path.

2. Execution Phase
   
   **Server side**
   - Run the command docker compose up --build -d in the /docker directory.
  
   **Client side**
   - Run docker compose up --build -d in the root path that contains the three elements mentioned above.
  
## **Docker Hub**

All of the images in this project are pushed to Docker Hub
